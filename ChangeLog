* Formatting tweaks and rebuild for vignette
* Fixed bug for difftime where there was an assumption that the units were in seconds

* Fail as expected for non-standard character input when character count is below 8.  This change restores code coverage to 100%
* Corrected issues in the github description and/or vignette and standardized the location so there is only one version of the expository text.
